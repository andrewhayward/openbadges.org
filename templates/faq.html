      <h2>Badges</h2>
      <h3>What is a badge?</h3>
      <p>
        A 'badge' is a symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality or interest. Badges can be used to represent achievements, communicate successes, set goals, and motivate behaviors,. They can support learning that happens in new ways and new spaces beyond the traditional classroom. These include online courses, after-school programs, work and life experiences. By providing a more complete picture of learners' skills and competencies, badges can signal achievement to a variety of communities and institutions including potential employers, educational organizations and social groups.
      </p>
      <h3>What do badges do?</h3>
      <p>Badges can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Capture a wide set of skills and achievements</li>
        <li>Provide concrete evidence and proof of your skills, achievements and qualities</li>
        <li>Represent them to potential employers, communities and stakeholders</li>
        <li>Unlock new career and learning opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why do we need badges?</h3>
      <p>
        In today's world, learning happens anywhere and everywhere. Opportunities for personal growth have expanded to include multiple contexts: social, informal, participatory, and creative. With all of this increased opportunity for learning, thereâ€™s been a piece missing. An essential piece. Formal recognition for these continually earned, hard-won competencies and skills. The solution? A badge ecosystem that can bridge this gap by providing occasions for individual learners to express their learning, skills and achievements through earned personal badge collections.
      </p>
      <h3>What are the benefits of badges?</h3>
		<p>Badges can:</p>
		<ul>
	    	<li>Signal achievement: Badges signal skills and achievements to peers, potential employers, educational institutions and others.</li>
	    	<li>Recognize informal learning: Learners can get credit and recognition for the learning that happens outside of school. e.g., in after-school programs, work experience or online.</li>
	    	<li>Transfer learning across spaces and contexts: Skills are made more portable across jobs, learning environments and places through badges.</li>
	    	<li>Capture more specific skills than traditional degrees: Badges allow a more granular recognition of specific skills than a traditional degree.</li>
	    	<li>Support greater specialization and innovation: Badges can support specialized and emerging fields that are not in traditional learning environments.</li>
	    	<li>Allow greater diversity: With recognition of "soft skills," social habits, motivation etc. badges are able to recognize a greater diversity of skills than traditional programs measure or recognize.</li>
	    	<li>Motivate participation and learning outcomes: Badges provide feedback, milestones and rewards throughout a course or learning experience, encouraging engagement and retention.</li>
	    	<li>Allow multiple pathways to learning: Badges encourage learners to take new paths or spend more time developing specific skills.</li>
	    	<li>Unlock privileges: For example, students at a school computer lab might be required to earn a "Digital Safety" badge before being allowed to surf the web.</li>
	    	<li>Enhance your identity and reputation: Badges raise your profile within the learning community and peers and allow you to aggregate identities from across other communities.</li>
	    	<li>Build community and social capital: Badges help learners find peers or mentors with similar interests. Community badges help formalize camaraderie, team synthesis and communities of practice.</li>
	    	<li>Capture the learning path and history: With degrees or cumulative grades, much of the learning path -- the set of steps and milestones that led to the degree -- is lost or hard to see. Badges can capture a more specific set of skills and qualities as they occur along the way, along with issue dates for each. This means we can track the set of steps the most successful learners take to gain their skills -- and potentially replicate that experience for others.</li>
	    	<li>Recognize new skills and literacies: New literacies that are critical to success in today's digital world -- like appropriating information, judging its quality, multitasking and networking -- are not typically taught in schools and don't show up on a transcript. Badges can recognize these new skills and literacies.</li>
	    	<li>Provide a more complete picture of the learner: Badges provide a more complete picture of skills and learning history for potential employers, schools, peer groups and others.</li>
		</ul>
      <h3>What kinds of skills and accomplishments can badges represent?</h3>
		<p>Badges can represent a diverse range of skills, competencies, qualities, achievements and interests, including:</p>
		<ul>
	    	<li>"hard skills" like completing a course, mastering a specific programming language or math concept</li>
	    	<li>"soft skills" like critical thinking, communication or collaboration</li>
	    	<li>community recognition like reputation and status</li>
	    	<li>new skills like digital literacies</li>
	    	<li>specific, granular accomplishments or activities like leaving helpful comments for other learners, logging into an online learning web site for 10 consecutive days</li>
		</ul>
      <h3>What form do badges take? Is it just something I stick on a web page or sew on my shirt?</h3>
    	<p>The badge itself is more than a static image or button -- its value comes from the information or "metadata" attached to it.</p>
    	<p>The information "behind" each badge provides justification and validation, including:</p>
        <ul>
			<li>who issued the badge</li>
        	<li>the issue date</li>
        	<li>how the badge was earned</li>
        	<li>hyperlinks back to artifacts, documents, or testimonials demonstrating the work that lead to earning the badge.</li>
        	<li>authentication back to the issuer</li>
		</ul>
    	<p>This supporting data reduces the risk of gaming the system (e.g., illegitimately copying badges and putting them on your site) and builds in an implicit validation system. The metadata may vary based on the particular skill, assessment and issuer.</p>
      <h3>Who can issue badges?</h3>
		<p>Badges can be created, defined and issued by a number of sources, including:</p>
		<ul>
	    	<li>Traditional educational institutions</li>
	    	<li>Professional bodies (e.g. doctors, engineers, accountants)</li>
	    	<li>International credential assessment agencies</li>
	    	<li>Non-formal, community learning organizations (e.g. Adult Basic Education, Literacy, Employment agencies)</li>
	    	<li>Communities of practice (e.g., open education projects, peer learners, or the individual learners themselves)</li>
	    	<li>After-school programs and learning networks</li>
	    	<li>Online courses and open courseware initiatives</li>
	    	<li>Companies/organizations that employ people</li>
		</ul>
