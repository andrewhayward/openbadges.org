      <h3>What is a Displayer?</h3>
      <p>
        A displayer is a website, organization, group or individual that accesses publicly shared badges from the Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI) and displays them for a user. Badge display plays a crucial role in the Open Badges ecosystem—part of a badge’s value resides in its usage or social currency. A factor that is affected by where and how badges are displayed. Social networking sites, discipline-oriented community portals, and job search sites, as well as personal sites and blogs are all potential badge displayers.
