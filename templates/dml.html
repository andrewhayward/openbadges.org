    <h3>Click this badge to send it to your Mozilla Open Badges hosted backpack</h3>
    <p><img src="/img/DML.png"></p>
    <p>When you click on the badge above, a few things happen - you'll be asked to 
    sign in to your backpack, then an assertion will be created that verifies you
    own the badge.  Your backpack will grab the badge image, grab the assertion data,
    and bake them into a badge that's now hosted on your
    Mozilla Open Badges backpack.</p>

    <p>The process of adding all this fancy issuing stuff is a relatively easy process.
    As long as you (as an issuer) have a hosted assertion (in simple JSON format) and
    can add a few lines of javascript, then you'll be able to issue a badge.  Easy
    Peasy.</p>
